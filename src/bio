I'm a self-taught computer programmer with a background in Javascript and C++. I mostly do back-end projects related to bots and automation, but occasionally I take requests for other projects.
I am also a full-stack web developer who has worked with React, MySql, and MongoDB.
Other than a programmer, I am a pianist, fledgling writer, and image editor.
